# Our Model

## Project Overview: Predicting Asthma Prevalence in Philadelphia

In this project, our goal is to predict asthma prevalence in Philadelphia census tracts using a machine learning algorithm. The entire process can be categorized into three main sections: Exploratory Analysis, Regression and Cross Validation, and Prediction.

## Exploratory Analysis:

Conducted an in-depth exploration of the dataset, identifying relevant risk factors.
Explored relationships between variables and asthma prevalence.
Cleaned and preprocessed data to prepare it for model training.

## Regression and Cross Validation:

Utilized regression analysis to understand the impact of various risk factors on asthma prevalence.
Employed cross-validation techniques to assess model performance and generalizability.
Explored different regression models to identify the most effective one.

Prediction using Random Forest Model:

After thorough cross-validation, opted for the Random Forest model as the most suitable for our prediction task.
Leveraged scikit-learn's machine learning library for model implementation.
Trained the model on the identified risk factors and census tract data.
